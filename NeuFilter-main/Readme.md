## Neural Kalman Filtering for Robust Temporal Recommendation

Hi there👋

This is the official implementation of **NeuFilter**, which is accepted by WSDM 2024.

We hope this code helps you well. If you use this code in your work, please cite our paper.

Note that we provide three tasks, the codes of which are slightly different, but we have made them orthogonal to each other in order to help you quickly reproduce the results.


### How to run this code

##### Step 1: Check the compatibility of your running environment. Generally, different running environments will still have a chance to cause different experimental results though all random processes are fixed in the code. Our running environment is

```
- GPU:  NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 (11GB)
- CUDA: 11.6
- Python Packages:
  - numpy: 1.23.5
  - pandas: 1.5.3
  - python: 3.8.16
  - pytorch: 1.13.0
  - scipy: 1.10.1
```



##### Step 2: Prepare the datasets. Please put your datasets under the folder ```data/``` in the corresponding tasks.

We only provide the smallest dataset ```video``` for the ```item recommendation``` task due to the upload speed issue. Other datasets can be accessed from the following links:

* ```item recommendation``` task
  * ML100K, Yoochoosebuy, ML1M: https://github.com/FDUDSDE/CoPE

* ```future interaction prediction ``` task and ```state change prediction``` task
  * Wikipedia: http://snap.stanford.edu/jodie/wikipedia.csv
  * Reddit: http://snap.stanford.edu/jodie/reddit.csv
  * LastFM: http://snap.stanford.edu/jodie/lastfm.csv

> Note that if you use your own datasets, please check their format so as to make sure that it matches the input format of ```NeuFilter```. The dataset format can refer to https://github.com/claws-lab/jodie.



##### Step 3: Run the code. 

* For ```item recommendation``` task, please use the following commands:

  ```bash
  cd item_recommendation
  mkdir saved_models  # If this directory exists, omit this code.
  python main.py --network video --gpu <your_gpu_index>
  ```



* For ```future interaction prediction``` task, please use the following commands

  ```bash
  # For Wikipedia dataset
  cd future_interaction_prediction
  mkdir saved_models  # If this directory exists, omit this code.
  python main.py --network wikipedia --gpu <your_gpu_index> --embedding_dim 16 --num_layer 4 --reg_factor1 1.0 --reg_factor2 0.003 --lr 0.001
  
  # For LastFM dataset
  cd future_interaction_prediction
  mkdir saved_models  # If this directory exists, omit this code.
  python main.py --network lastfm --gpu <your_gpu_index>
  ```



* For ```state change prediction``` task, please use the following commands:

  ```bash
  cd state_change_prediction
  mkdir saved_models  # If this directory exists, omit this code.
  python main.py --network wikipedia --gpu <your_gpu_index>
  ```
